## *what is Git?*
### Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes we make to files, so we have a record of what has been done, and we can revert to specific versions should we ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. So regardless of whether we write code that only we will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for us.

### during the labs we have learned a lot about *Git* and how to use it, it provides many features that can help us. we can control and edit files that have been done, by doing these commands:
- to add a file we enter: mkdir
- to list what's inside the file we enter: ls
- to creat a file we enter: touch 
- to go back to the previous file we enter: cd .. 
- to upload the new changes we enter the following: 
    1. git add
    2. git commit -m "the reason"
    3. git push origin master 


 ### try to think about how great **Git** is !!
