## *first le's talk about Comparison and logical operators*


### to evaluate a situation by comparing one value of the scriot to what you expect it might be, the result will be boolean, it's either:
- true
- false

## we have many comparison operators, for example; 
1. == it means that : it equals to
2. != it means that : it is *NOT* equal to
3. === it means that : it is strict equal to
4. <  > these me : greater than or less than
5. <=  it means that : less than or equal to
6. =< it means that : greater than or equal to.

## *now it's time to talk about for loops and while loops*
### loops consist of :
     - initialization for example:  -  var i = 2;
     - condition for example:  i<= 8
     - update for example: i++
