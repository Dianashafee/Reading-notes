 # *Epressions & Oparators*

## Expressions

### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE, this is done using
the assignment operator (the equals sign). e.g. :
       1. var color = red 
       2. var font-size = 32px 

- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE,You can perform operations on any number of values to determine asingle value. e.g.: 
       1. var area = 2*5 >>> value of area is 6. 


## Oparators 

### Expressions rely on things,  they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
  *color = 'beige';*

- STRING OPERATORS
 *greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'welcome';*

- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
  *area = 3 * 2;*

- COMPARISON OPERATORS 
  *buy = 3 > 5;*

- LOGICAL OPERATORS 
  *buy= (5 > 1) && (2 < 4);* 



## what is a function 

### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
